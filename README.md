- Audio interface and gateware from my existing [eurorack-pmod](https://github.com/apfaudio/eurorack-pmod) project.
- USB interface and gateware based on [LUNA and Cynthion](https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/luna/) projects.
- USB Audio gateware and descriptors based on [adat-usb2-audio-interface](https://github.com/hansfbaier/adat-usb2-audio-interface).
- Some gateware is also inherited from the [Glasgow](https://github.com/GlasgowEmbedded/glasgow) project.
